formulator
========================

Welcome to the documentation for django-formulator!


This software is in design/alpha stage!


Abstract
-----------------------------------

Formulator is not a survey app. It just saves django form definitions in the db,
that developers can use in their views. In other words you get a dynamic subclass of
django BaseForm.

You can provide your own class base to handle the saving part. This makes it really
easy to define forms (or in a way, models) for data that will be saved in NoSQL dbs.


Usage
-----------------------------------

:Todo


Running the Tests
------------------------------------

You can run the tests with via::

    make test
